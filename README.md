# Iptvnator_rs

An iptvclient that is capable of parsing and reading m3uplaylists of essentially arbitrary sizes _blazingly fast_

# Install

Just clone the repo and run ```cargo build --release``` to compile the project. Then put it in your PATH or make a shortcut to the binary (target/release/iptvnator)
You will need to install mpv, and have it in your path, otherwise it wont work
